//Just changed some typos in lines 131 and 138 of the game file
//I love the story line!
//There's a bug where if the user's HP falls below 0, they still get another attack before game over
//It looks like the final fight will be against kakashi? that would be cool.
//If not, having some text that explains you beat the game would be nice
